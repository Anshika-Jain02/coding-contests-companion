## About

Coding Contests Companion is a discord bot that displays ongoing and upcoming coding contests from CodeChef, LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeForces, AtCoder, and HackerEarth, and sends notification an hour before any contest is about to start. **Never miss a coding contest again!**

It can also send a random problem selected by LeetCode everyday covering a variety of topics to keep you consistent, sharp, and ready ðŸ’ª
